# WEBD102: Developing Web Content

> **15 credits**

Whether they are static or dynamic, web pages are a combination of two things: content and layout.  

This module covers the basic technologies on which the Web is founded. Aspects covered include: historic development of the Web; 'architecture' and basic client server architecture; protocols such as HTTP; content markup (HTML, CSS, XML) and issues of accessibility and usability; standards and standardisation organisations (W3C, Internet working group); and security (firewalls, HTTPS, certificates).

You will also explore how best to transform text provided by a client into text for use on a web page.  This may involve little more than editing to correct errors; or it may involve a significant change in style.  So, you will learn how to transform boring, unstructure text into an interesting web page.
