# PROG101: Introductory Programming

> **30 credits**

Coding is at the heart of almost every computer application.  

In this module, you will develop your coding skills using the Python programming language - not because it is necessarily the most widely used language, or because it is the one you will continue to use through your career.  You will be using Python because it allows you to develop skills with all of the coding constructs that underpin the vast majority of programming languages.

You’ll be introduced to a range of problem solving strategies, which you’ll practise as you solve a number of coding challenges.

The assessment of this module will be based on a programming project.
