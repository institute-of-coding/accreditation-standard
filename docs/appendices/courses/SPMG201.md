# SPMG201: Service & Project Management

> **15 credits**

This module is arranged in two parts: _Service Management_ and _Project Management_.

## Service Management
In the first part of the module, you’ll look at how service management helps to ensure that users and customers receive from IT systems services that they value. Referencing the widely used service management framework, ITIL®, you’ll start by exploring what’s needed to operate existing services effectively, then look at how to identify where, when and why there might be scope for improving services. You’ll go on to consider some of the strategic drivers for providing services to customers, and how to understand their value. You’ll look also at the wide range of things that need to be addressed when designing a service, and then rolling it out into use. The part concludes by looking at how all these aspects of service management interact in the context of the ITIL Service Lifecycle.

## Project Management
This second part of the module will introduce you to project management, with an emphasis on managing software projects. You’ll cover project management techniques and topics – such as project planning and activity planning, and managing risk and allocating resources. You’ll also focus on the techniques that are most relevant to software project management, including:

* choosing an appropriate software development approach
* estimating how much development effort will be required
* exploring the tools and techniques for monitoring the progress of projects.
