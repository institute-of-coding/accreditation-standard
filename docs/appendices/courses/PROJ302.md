# PROJ302: Final Project

> **30 credits**

This module is the capstone professional project for your degree programme.
You will need to develop and deliver one or more artefact(s) for a real customer external to the University.  You should aim to build on the experience you gained during one of your summer internships.

You will need to follow the complete lifecycle for each artefact, using whichever approach you think appropriate (e.g., agile, iterative etc.).  You must also follow all relevant professional and ethical guidelines.

As this is a real-life project, you should expect to encounter difficulties and challenges, which you should document appropriately, and discuss in your project report.  

You should be careful not to take on too much; but you must ensure that the experience you gain – including any failures – demonstrates your competence at level 3 in at least one of the five key SFIA skills for the degree:

- Information Security SCTY
- Programming/software development PROG
- Requirements definition and management REQM
- Systems integration and build SINT
- Release and deployment RELM
Be aware that your customer will contribute to your assessment on this module.
