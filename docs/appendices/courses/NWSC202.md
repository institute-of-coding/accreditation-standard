# NWSC202 : Network & Web Security

> **15 credits**

This module builds on the networking and security concepts introduced in NWSC101, and explores some of the security issues that are most relevant to web services and their associated protocols.

You will learn to identify common web vulnerabilities, such as injection (for sql, javascript and html) and appropriate countermeasures and resilient approaches that should be adopted to minimise these risks.
