# SYSI301:  Systems Integration & Testing

> **15 credits**

It doesn't matter how carefully you have developed and tested a component of a system, it is still essential that the system of which it is a part is tested as a whole.  For example, does the system still do everything that it is supposed to do, even if your new component isn't supposed to affect the existing functions?  And are you sure that the latest build - which now contains _your_ new component - actually still has all the latest versions of all the other components?

System integration and testing must themselves be discipline, not just ad-hoc processes, if they are to be effective.

In this module, you will explore the processes for developing and managing test processes and procedures, and how test-driven development can be used to minimise disruptions due to faulty code.  

And you will examine how the use of a formal version control repository can minimise the risk of losing updates during a build.
