# LEAN302 : Business Agility

> **15 credits**

This module is based on a series of case studies which will explore how enterprises:

- choose how to exploit cloud technologies (private, public and hybrid);
- select development approaches that are appropriate for their needs and environment (lean, agile, iterative, waterfall etc.)
- identify the most appropriate technologies and environments to support their needs
- find an appropriate balance between insourcing and outsourcing
- choose between different vendors, and ensure that contracts and agreements are fit for purpose

For your assessment, you will select a major software development undertaken by a particular company, research published information on how successful that development was, and review how well the company followed the principles discussed in the module.
