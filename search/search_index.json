How do you create products that everybody wants? One of the fundamental things you will learn in this module is the importance of user-centred design. You will learn the value of moving away from your desk and \u2018stepping out into the world\u2019 to involve potential users in your early design ideas for interactive products. It is all too easy to assume that others think, feel and behave in the same way as we, the designer or developer, do. It is essential to take into account the diversity among users and their different perspectives and getting their feedback will help you to avoid any errors and misunderstandings that you may not have thought of. Involving users in the process is vital to creating great products and makes good business sense: after all, who wants to buy a bad product? This module has three parts, which explore the key issues in user-centred design. Part 1 - Requirements Who are the users and what do they want? As part of the process of defining the requirements for an interactive product we need to know the user\u2019s characteristics but we also need to be aware of the user\u2019s context \u2013 both in terms of their physical environment and in terms of the activities they are engaged in. This block studies a range of requirement gathering approaches including talking to users, observational methods including the use of technology probes, and more. You will also learn to use tools and techniques such as developing personas and scenarios, which will help you share information with the stakeholders (the team, the users, the customer) and communicate effectively about the requirements for an interactive product. Part 2 \u2013 Design Designing is about balancing the requirements. It involves thinking through the underlying idea for the interactive product and the more concrete, physical aspects. This block tackles all these things. You will learn to use reflective tools to help you work out and communicate the main idea for a design, including what users will be able to do with it, and how they will experience it. We discuss a range of interface types, from more traditional screen-based forms of interaction to mobile, wearable, haptic and other interface types and you will learn and use a range of prototyping methods and tools. Part 3 \u2013 Evaluation Evaluating an interactive product is essential to ensure that it meets the requirements or to identify ways in which it can be improved so that it does meet the requirements. This block presents the knowledge and techniques necessary to evaluate, including ethical considerations when evaluating with users; techniques and tips for observing users, and asking experts and users; and how to decide when to carry out field studies and when to use lab studies. You will learn how to present your findings and to reflect on the need for iteration of parts of the design life cycle.

It provides a common reference model in a two-dimensional framework consisting of skills on one axis and seven levels of responsibility on the other.

Furthermore, \u201cemployability\u201d needs to be at the heart of the IoC standard \u2013 it is not something that can be retro-fitted to an academic curriculum based on an encyclopaedic Body of Knowledge. 2.3. Bodies of Knowledge Academics and professional bodies have lots of experience of developing bodies of knowledge (BoKs). Typically, they draw upon (their own) existing courses, frameworks from external bodies such as Turing Institute or the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Significant reference points also include existing bodies of knowledge such as those published by ACM/IEEE. However, it should be noted that these tend to focus very much on academic content, rather than on practice. Furthermore, BoKs tend to aim to be universal, inclusive, exhaustive, complete, exhausting etc. With the possible (but unlikely) exception of really focussed BoKs like CyBok, addressing the whole of a BoK within a single degree programme would probably be extremely challenging. BoKs should be reference points, from which curricula are drawn, rather than templates for curricula. 2.4. Accreditation standards An accreditation standard is a statement of what all (accredited) graduates should achieve. For a degree, a standard must deliver the explicit outcomes included in both the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) outcomes statement and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) subject benchmark statement. In computing, the QAA SBS specifies a set of generic skills, and requires that the design of a curriculum should refer to the ACM BoK. There is no direct 1-1 mapping from a BoK to a realistic Standard; any resulting \u201cstandard\u201d would be a large, constraining, conjunctive \u201ctick list\u201d (like the Tech Partnership Degrees DTS degree apprenticeships.) If a BoK is used as a standard, then if a graduate fails to achieve any one item in the BoK, then they should fail their degree \u2013 which is neither realistic nor helpful, in the context of the IoC\u2019s aims. Rather than focus purely on (yet another) BoK, it is proposed that the focus be changed from knowledge to competence . 2.5. Competence Competence is more than being able to get correct answers to problems, or write correct code, or complete any other kind of university exercise. It\u2019s more than just practice, in a \u201cprotected\u201d university environment in which nobody can get hurt.

The IoC standard \u2013 principles"},{"location":"standard/standard/","text":"IoC Degree Standards Bachelor's degree with honours Graduates should: have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for SFIA Level 3; have demonstrated competence in one or more relevant SFIA skills at level 3 (the competence skill(s)); have underpinning knowledge for a total of four SFIA skills at levels 3 or 4, including the competence skill(s), and with at least one at SFIA level 4; understand and apply the legal, social, ethical and professional principles that are relevant to their chosen skills; demonstrate an understanding of the need for sustainable computing in the context of their chosen skills. Master's degree Graduates should: have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for SFIA Level 4; have demonstrated competence in at least one relevant SFIA skills at level 4 (the competence skill(s)); have underpinning knowledge for a total of three SFIA skills at levels 4 or 5, including the competence skills, and with at least one at SFIA level 5; understand and apply the legal, social, ethical and professional principles that are relevant to their chosen skills; demonstrate an understanding of the need for sustainable computing in the context of their chosen skills. Note that these standards make no assumptions about the format of delivery of a degree \u2013 so, for example, the standards apply equally to university-based degrees, degree apprenticeships and degrees incorporating an industrial placement. Furthermore, the standards are threshold requirements: good or excellent students from IoC programmes may exceed the relevant standard, and this should be reflected in the classification of their degree. Explanatory Notes The demonstration of competence in a SFIA skill requires that students have completed relevant tasks more than just once or twice in a controlled/safe environment. They should have had repeated experience of those tasks in varying contexts, sufficient to be competent to deploy the skill for a real customer or as an independent practitioner, without needing routine supervision. In order to achieve competence in any SFIA skill, graduates must also have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for the corresponding SFIA level. Demonstrating these characteristics will probably require evidence from completing a number of independent projects within the scope of the chosen SFIA skill together with evidence of generic leadership and business skills. Since the underpinning knowledge required for at least one skill at SFIA Level 4/5 may be for the same SFIA skill as a \"competence\" skill, the requirement for underpinning knowledge is for sufficient skills to bring the total number of SFIA skills demonstrated \u2013 either by underpinning knowledge or through competence \u2013 to the number required for the specific standard \u2013 that is, a total of four skills for a Bachelor\u2019s degree and three for a Master\u2019s. Some SFIA skills are not defined for the lower levels (2, 3, 4). If such skill a would be appropriate for a particular programme, the IoC may approach SFIA to extend the skill definition to include the required level. In the meantime, the IoC Accreditation Panel may accept a draft description of the skill at the required level. The computing profession is subject to a range of legal and ethical requirements which may be specific to particular skill areas \u2013 such as accessibility law \u2013 or may be more generic \u2013 such as the provisions of GDPR. Graduates should be fully aware of the legal and ethical requirements that will affect them, as well as the social and professional responsibilities that arise in their work. It is likely that sufficient detail of legal and ethical requirements will have been taught alongside technical material for graduates to have a sound understanding of how these requirements affect their activities. In addition to these explicit requirements, it is likely that any graduate achieving the standard will have additional underpinning knowledge, and possibly competence, corresponding to several additional SFIA skills at Levels 1, 2 or (for Master\u2019s degrees) 3. Instantiation The separation of the standard from the specific curricula (in parallel workstreams 1.2, 1.3 and themes 2/3) mean that the standard itself must be flexible and adaptable. The standard is phrased in terms of demonstration of competence corresponding to responsibility levels in the SFIA framework, but does not mandate any particular skills. Since the responsibility characteristics in SFIA are common across all skills, and the tasks specified at a particular level for different skills are broadly comparable in difficulty, this abstraction approach allows the specification of a standard that is independent of the particular subject focus \u2013 just as the FHEQ, QAA SBS and BCS accreditation requirements are independent of any particular focus. This generic standard can then be instantiated for a number of distinct subject areas, determined by the SFIA skills selected. Recognition of achievement It is proposed that the achievement of \"competence\" and (underpinning) \"knowledge\" for particular SFIA skills at the required levels will be recognised by the award of IoC/SFIA badges.

Furthermore, the standards are threshold requirements: good or excellent students from IoC programmes may exceed the relevant standard, and this should be reflected in the classification of their degree.","title":"Master's degree"},{"location":"standard/standard/#explanatory-notes","text":"The demonstration of competence in a SFIA skill requires that students have completed relevant tasks more than just once or twice in a controlled/safe environment. They should have had repeated experience of those tasks in varying contexts, sufficient to be competent to deploy the skill for a real customer or as an independent practitioner, without needing routine supervision. In order to achieve competence in any SFIA skill, graduates must also have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for the corresponding SFIA level. Demonstrating these characteristics will probably require evidence from completing a number of independent projects within the scope of the chosen SFIA skill together with evidence of generic leadership and business skills. Since the underpinning knowledge required for at least one skill at SFIA Level 4/5 may be for the same SFIA skill as a \"competence\" skill, the requirement for underpinning knowledge is for sufficient skills to bring the total number of SFIA skills demonstrated \u2013 either by underpinning knowledge or through competence \u2013 to the number required for the specific standard \u2013 that is, a total of four skills for a Bachelor\u2019s degree and three for a Master\u2019s. Some SFIA skills are not defined for the lower levels (2, 3, 4). If such skill a would be appropriate for a particular programme, the IoC may approach SFIA to extend the skill definition to include the required level. In the meantime, the IoC Accreditation Panel may accept a draft description of the skill at the required level. The computing profession is subject to a range of legal and ethical requirements which may be specific to particular skill areas \u2013 such as accessibility law \u2013 or may be more generic \u2013 such as the provisions of GDPR. Graduates should be fully aware of the legal and ethical requirements that will affect them, as well as the social and professional responsibilities that arise in their work. It is likely that sufficient detail of legal and ethical requirements will have been taught alongside technical material for graduates to have a sound understanding of how these requirements affect their activities. In addition to these explicit requirements, it is likely that any graduate achieving the standard will have additional underpinning knowledge, and possibly competence, corresponding to several additional SFIA skills at Levels 1, 2 or (for Master\u2019s degrees) 3.","title":"Explanatory Notes"},{"location":"standard/standard/#instantiation","text":"The separation of the standard from the specific curricula (in parallel workstreams 1.2, 1.3 and themes 2/3) mean that the standard itself must be flexible and adaptable. The standard is phrased in terms of demonstration of competence corresponding to responsibility levels in the SFIA framework, but does not mandate any particular skills. Since the responsibility characteristics in SFIA are common across all skills, and the tasks specified at a particular level for different skills are broadly comparable in difficulty, this abstraction approach allows the specification of a standard that is independent of the particular subject focus \u2013 just as the FHEQ, QAA SBS and BCS accreditation requirements are independent of any particular focus. This generic standard can then be instantiated for a number of distinct subject areas, determined by the SFIA skills selected.","title":"Instantiation"},{"location":"standard/standard/#recognition-of-achievement","text":"It is proposed that the achievement of \"competence\" and (underpinning) \"knowledge\" for particular SFIA skills at the required levels will be recognised by the award of IoC/SFIA badges.
