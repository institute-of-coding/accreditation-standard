SFIA gives individuals and organisations a common language to define skill, abilities and expertise in a consistent way. It provides a common reference model in a two-dimensional framework consisting of skills on one axis and seven levels of responsibility on the other.

As the latest, post-Shadbolt, venture seeking to address the \u201cdigital skills gap\u201d, the focus is on digital skills for the workplace, rather than on knowledge and learning for their own sake. 2.2. Digital skills for the workplace The primary requirements of employers include \u2013 graduates must be billable (competent) graduates must be adaptable (underpinning knowledge for cognate skill areas) graduates must be effective problem solvers (which is fundamentally what university education is about) Note that these are the fundamental drivers for the IoC, not some nebulous concept of \u201cemployability\u201d. Furthermore, \u201cemployability\u201d needs to be at the heart of the IoC standard \u2013 it is not something that can be retro-fitted to an academic curriculum based on an encyclopaedic Body of Knowledge. 2.3. Bodies of Knowledge Academics and professional bodies have lots of experience of developing bodies of knowledge (BoKs). Typically, they draw upon (their own) existing courses, frameworks from external bodies such as Turing Institute or the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Significant reference points also include existing bodies of knowledge such as those published by ACM/IEEE. However, it should be noted that these tend to focus very much on academic content, rather than on practice. Furthermore, BoKs tend to aim to be universal, inclusive, exhaustive, complete, exhausting etc. With the possible (but unlikely) exception of really focussed BoKs like CyBok, addressing the whole of a BoK within a single degree programme would probably be extremely challenging. BoKs should be reference points, from which curricula are drawn, rather than templates for curricula. 2.4. Accreditation standards An accreditation standard is a statement of what all (accredited) graduates should achieve. For a degree, a standard must deliver the explicit outcomes included in both the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) outcomes statement and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) subject benchmark statement. In computing, the QAA SBS specifies a set of generic skills, and requires that the design of a curriculum should refer to the ACM BoK. There is no direct 1-1 mapping from a BoK to a realistic Standard; any resulting \u201cstandard\u201d would be a large, constraining, conjunctive \u201ctick list\u201d (like the Tech Partnership Degrees DTS degree apprenticeships.) If a BoK is used as a standard, then if a graduate fails to achieve any one item in the BoK, then they should fail their degree \u2013 which is neither realistic nor helpful, in the context of the IoC\u2019s aims. Rather than focus purely on (yet another) BoK, it is proposed that the focus be changed from knowledge to competence . 2.5. Competence Competence is more than being able to get correct answers to problems, or write correct code, or complete any other kind of university exercise. It\u2019s more than just practice, in a \u201cprotected\u201d university environment in which nobody can get hurt.

The IoC standard \u2013 principles"},{"location":"standard/sfia-based/","text":"A SFIA-based standard An initial proposal for an IoC standard might be: A graduate from an IoC honours degree should have demonstrated competence in at least one skill at Level 3 , and should have the knowledge to underpin at least one SFIA skill at Level 4 , and at least 2 other relevant skills at level 3. They should be able to demonstrate all of the generic skills for Level 3 . For a graduate from a degree apprenticeship (where there is significant relevant work experience), this might be adapted to: A graduate from an IoC degree apprenticeship should be able to demonstrate competence in at least one SFIA skill at level 4, in one additional skill at level 3, and at have the knowledge to underpin least 2 more relevant skills at level 3. They should be able to demonstrate all of the generic skills for level 4. Note that the numbers of skills , and the definition of which ones would be relevant , are open to discussion. For example, it might be that the target for competence should be Level 4, rather than three, but that may be unrealistic in the absence of significant workbased experience (such as a placement year, or WB learning integrated into a Degree Apprenticeship). The \u201cgeneric skills\u201d for levels 3 are reproduced in Appendix 1, as are a selection of skill descriptors which might be relevant for data analytics and cyber-security curricula. This model could be readily adapted for Master\u2019s level degrees and apprenticeships, and also for sub-degree chunks (e.g, for theme 3). In addition, \u201clayering\u201d would be possible, so that, for example, level 1 of an IoC degree might be required to underpin skills at SFIA level 1 or 2. Alternatively, for Theme 3, and appropriate IoC accreditation might focus on a single SFIA skill at level 3 or 4, or perhaps three or four skills at level 2 (depending on the domain requirements). Commentary The skills listed in Appendix 1 are, at this stage, exemplars \u2013 there is no intention that this should be the prescriptive list for the data analytics standard to be developed by IoC. The principal advantages of adopting a standard based on SFIA include: Use of the SFIA framework provides an abstraction mechanism that can assure comparable standards across different curricula; The SFIA \u201cgeneric\u201d skills provide a core which seems to correspond both to IfA requirements, FHEQ and QAA benchmark statements and also to BCS CITP accreditation requirements. The abstraction mechanism allows those working on different curricula to select appropriate skills; SFIA is not prescriptive about how competence is developed - it allows providers to choose how to deliver that competence, and for competence to be developed by different providers within a single qualification; SFIA is widely recognised across industry \u2013 both in the UK and internationally. SFIA focusses on what it means to be competent \u2013 i.e., useful to an employer \u2013 rather than on curriculum input Given that the focus is on exemplars to demonstrate competence, so that different individuals (students/apprenticeships) may have strengths in different aspects of a skill, this approach avoids the \u201cconjunctive shopping list\u201d approach of other standards. BCS and IET are core partners in the SFIA Foundation. Final comments The generic skills cover virtually all of the explicit requirements in the QAA subject benchmark statement (SBS), FHEQ and also those specified by IfA for apprenticeships. Requiring underpinning knowledge for additional SFIA skills completes FHEQ/QAA requirements.

The principal advantages of adopting a standard based on SFIA include: Use of the SFIA framework provides an abstraction mechanism that can assure comparable standards across different curricula; The SFIA \u201cgeneric\u201d skills provide a core which seems to correspond both to IfA requirements, FHEQ and QAA benchmark statements and also to BCS CITP accreditation requirements. The abstraction mechanism allows those working on different curricula to select appropriate skills; SFIA is not prescriptive about how competence is developed - it allows providers to choose how to deliver that competence, and for competence to be developed by different providers within a single qualification; SFIA is widely recognised across industry \u2013 both in the UK and internationally. SFIA focusses on what it means to be competent \u2013 i.e., useful to an employer \u2013 rather than on curriculum input Given that the focus is on exemplars to demonstrate competence, so that different individuals (students/apprenticeships) may have strengths in different aspects of a skill, this approach avoids the \u201cconjunctive shopping list\u201d approach of other standards. BCS and IET are core partners in the SFIA Foundation.","title":"Commentary"},{"location":"standard/sfia-based/#final-comments","text":"The generic skills cover virtually all of the explicit requirements in the QAA subject benchmark statement (SBS), FHEQ and also those specified by IfA for apprenticeships.
