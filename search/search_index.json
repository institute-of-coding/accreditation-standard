The worked example is based on Bachelor\u2019s degree for a \"web developer\" profile, which is entirely arbitrary, but should be sufficiently widely understood to serve as a generic example. The IoC standard The IoC standard for a Bachelor\u2019s degree with honours specifies that students should: have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for SFIA Level 3; have demonstrated competence in one or more relevant SFIA skills at level 3 (the competence skill(s)); have underpinning knowledge for a total of four SFIA skills at levels 3 or 4, including the competence skill(s), and with at least one at SFIA level 4; understand and apply the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues, and drivers for sustainable computing that are relevant to the chosen skills; The demonstration of competence requires that students have not done things just once or twice, in a controlled/safe environment, but have had experience sufficient to be competent to deploy the skills for a real customer, without needing routine supervision. In order to achieve competence in any SFIA skill, graduates must have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for SFIA Level 3. Demonstrating these characteristics requires evidence of experience from completing a number of independent projects within the scope of the chosen SFIA skill together with evidence of generic leadership and business skills. Since the underpinning knowledge required for at least one skill at SFIA Level 4 may be for the same SFIA skill as that for the \"competence\" skill, the requirement for underpinning knowledge In this case would be for three additional skills at SFIA Level 3. If the underpinning knowledge at SFIA Level 4 is for a SFIA skill different from the \"competence\" skill, then the requirement for underpinning knowledge is for one skill at SFIA Level 4 and two further skills at Level 3, in addition to that for the \"competence\" skill. The computing profession is subject to a range of legal and ethical requirements which may be specific to particular skill areas \u2013 such as accessibility law \u2013 or may be more generic \u2013 such as the provisions of GDPR. Graduates should be fully aware of the legal and ethical requirements that will affect them, as well as the social and professional responsibilities that arise in their work. It is likely that sufficient detail of legal and ethical requirements will have been taught alongside technical material for graduates to have a sound understanding of how these requirements affect their activities. In addition to these explicit requirements, it is likely that any graduate achieving the standard will also have underpinning knowledge, and possibly competence, for several SFIA skills at Levels 1 or 2. Outline process Identify SFIA skills that would be relevant for the required role Review the selected skills against industry / academic requirements \u2013 address any gaps Review the skills identified to determine which should be output (SFIA Level 3) requirements and which are needed as \"underpinning\" at SFIA/HE levels 1/2 Refine the list of output SFIA skills until there are 4 or 5 at SFIA level 3. This may involve either \"demoting\" skills if too many are deemed relevant or adding additional generic skills should there be too few. For each of the selected SFIA skills, identify what knowledge is required to underpin the skill Identify what prior knowledge would be required for each package of knowledge Identify opportunities for experience development that could be incorporated into the curriculum (to allow students to build evidence of competence). Package the learning into modules, to create a curriculum Check learning dependencies between modules Map contributions from each module to output SFIA skills. Process \u2013 worked example In this section, we work through the development of the \"web developer\" degree programme summarised in the Appendix: Web Developer Example . 1. Identify SFIA skills Identify SFIA skills that would be relevant for the required role. The initial list of SFIA skills is constructed simply by considering each of the skill areas in turn. Information security information content publishing data management portfolio, programme and project support requirements definition and management software design programming/software development data modelling and design Testing information content authoring user experience design user experience evaluation systems integration and build service design - service level management service transition - configuration management, asset management, change management, release and deployment service operation - system software, security administration, application support, IT infrastructure, database administration, storage management, network support, problem management, incident management Quality management Quality assurance Measurement stakeholder management - supplier management, customer service support sales and marketing - marketing, sales support, product management This list is clearly too long, and some of the skills identified are areas for which only superficial knowledge may be needed. 2. Review the selected skills Review the selected skills against industry / academic requirements against industry / academic requirements. Reviewing the skills identified, one further skill was added \u2013 Solution Architecture. This is defined only from level 4 in SFIA v7, but something in this area is important underpinning for any web developer. 3. Review the skills identified Review the skills identified to determine which should be output (SFIA Level 3) requirements and which are needed as \"underpinning\" at SFIA/HE levels 1/2. The third stage is to refine the list of possible skills under four headings: Level 3/4 target Level 2 underpinning Only awareness needed Not relevant Level 3/4 target Information security SCTY requirements definition and management REQM programming/software development PROG systems integration and build SINT release and deployment RELM Level 2 underpinning Solution Architecture ARCH (not currently defined at level 2) portfolio, programme and project support PROF data modelling and design DTAN information content authoring INCA user experience design HCEV Awareness only service design - {service level management} service transition - {configuration management, asset management, change management, release and deployment} service operation {system software, security administration, application support, IT infrastructure, database administration, storage management, network support, problem management, incident management} Not relevant Note that some of the skills identified under this heading are \"not relevant\" simply because they are subsumed in other skills already selected. For example, user experience evaluation is part of user experience design. information content publishing data management software design Testing Quality management Quality assurance Measurement user experience evaluation stakeholder management - supplier management, customer service support sales and marketing - marketing, sales support, product management 4. Refine the list Refine the list of output SFIA skills until there are 4 or 5 at SFIA level 3. This may involve either \"demoting\" skills if too many are deemed relevant or adding additional generic skills should there be too few. In this iteration, there are 5 target skills for levels 3 or 4. Hence, the set of target skills should both be achievable and offer sufficient breadth. 5. Identify underpinning knowledge For each of the selected SFIA skills, identify what knowledge is required to underpin the skill. For underpinning knowledge, look at the skill description for Level 3. In some cases, the description of the activities are already fairly close to a description of the knowledge required, for example, Information content authoring Level 2 INCA2. For others, the underpinning knowledge may simply be, \"know how to\u2026\". For example, for Data Modelling and Design DTAN L2 : Applies data analysis, design, and modelling techniques to establish, modify or maintain a data structure and its associated components (entity descriptions, relationship descriptions, attribute definitions). The relevant underpinning knowledge might be: Know how to apply data analysis, design, and modelling techniques to establish, modify or maintain a data structure and its associated components. This will include understanding how to construct entity descriptions, relationship descriptions and attribute definitions. 6. Identify prior knowledge Identify what prior knowledge would be required for each package of knowledge. Some skills may need to be contextualised. For example, Programming/Software Development PROG is generic, but this particular programme is for web developers. So, PROG L3 : Designs, codes, verifies, tests, documents, amends and refactors moderately complex programs/scripts. Applies agreed standards and tools, to achieve a well-engineered result. Collaborates in reviews of work with others as appropriate. Needs to be interpreted in the context of web development \u2013 both server-side and client-side scripts, in a range of languages, and probably using databases and other technologies. Thus, the underpinning knowledge is likely to be built on introductory programming, display elements, scripting languages, database definition and manipulation and an understanding of the architecture options for web apps. This is standard curriculum construction \u2013 high level outputs need to be grounded in lower level skills. 7. Identify experience opportunities Identify opportunities for experience development that could be incorporated into the curriculum (to allow students to build evidence of competence). Building competence through experience \u2013 and accumulating evidence of that experience \u2013 is central to an IoC degree. There are many ways in which opportunities for real experience may be built into a degree programme. The mechanisms chosen for this worked example are: Two \"clinic\" modules, in which students, under supervision, provide website construction/development for (paying) local customers Industry-sponsored and mentored group projects in years 2 and 3 Summer internships between years 1 & 2 and/or years 2 and 3 A final year project that should deliver at least one product for a \"real\" customer. 8. Package into modules Package the learning into modules, to create a curriculum. The draft curriculum is shown here With the exception of the higher than usual proportion of experience modules (necessary to deliver competence) and the fairly tight focus on web development, the curriculum actually looks fairly traditional. It may lack a little breadth compared with a traditional programme, and happens, in this example, to lack any explicit options. However, there will be considerable choice for students in how they focus their activities in the experience modules. 9. Check learning dependencies This is, again, standard curriculum design. The dependencies between modules are shown in the \"builds on\" / \"supports\" links in the module descriptions. 10. Map to SFIA skills Map contributions from each module to output SFIA skills. The purpose of the model curriculum is to ensure that students meet the IoC standard. A good final check in the design of the curriculum is to ensure that the knowledge required for each of the target skills is covered, probably across several modules, and that there are ample opportunities for appropriate experience to be gained. It is helpful here to consider the links from the skill descriptions to the modules that underpin them.","title":"Designing a Curriculum"},{"location":"appendices/design/#process-to-design-an-ioc-curriculum","text":"","title":"Process to design an IoC curriculum"},{"location":"appendices/design/#introduction","text":"This document outlines a process to develop a degree curriculum that will satisfy the IoC standard.

How do you create products that everybody wants? One of the fundamental things you will learn in this module is the importance of user-centred design. You will learn the value of moving away from your desk and \u2018stepping out into the world\u2019 to involve potential users in your early design ideas for interactive products. It is all too easy to assume that others think, feel and behave in the same way as we, the designer or developer, do. It is essential to take into account the diversity among users and their different perspectives and getting their feedback will help you to avoid any errors and misunderstandings that you may not have thought of. Involving users in the process is vital to creating great products and makes good business sense: after all, who wants to buy a bad product? This module has three parts, which explore the key issues in user-centred design. Part 1 - Requirements Who are the users and what do they want? As part of the process of defining the requirements for an interactive product we need to know the user\u2019s characteristics but we also need to be aware of the user\u2019s context \u2013 both in terms of their physical environment and in terms of the activities they are engaged in. This block studies a range of requirement gathering approaches including talking to users, observational methods including the use of technology probes, and more. You will also learn to use tools and techniques such as developing personas and scenarios, which will help you share information with the stakeholders (the team, the users, the customer) and communicate effectively about the requirements for an interactive product. Part 2 \u2013 Design Designing is about balancing the requirements. It involves thinking through the underlying idea for the interactive product and the more concrete, physical aspects. This block tackles all these things. You will learn to use reflective tools to help you work out and communicate the main idea for a design, including what users will be able to do with it, and how they will experience it. We discuss a range of interface types, from more traditional screen-based forms of interaction to mobile, wearable, haptic and other interface types and you will learn and use a range of prototyping methods and tools. Part 3 \u2013 Evaluation Evaluating an interactive product is essential to ensure that it meets the requirements or to identify ways in which it can be improved so that it does meet the requirements. This block presents the knowledge and techniques necessary to evaluate, including ethical considerations when evaluating with users; techniques and tips for observing users, and asking experts and users; and how to decide when to carry out field studies and when to use lab studies.

Requirements Some overarching targets are givens: FHEQ (Framework for Higher Education Qualifications) outcomes statement equivalents for Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland QAA (Quality Assurance Agency) subject benchmark statement (for degree apprenticeships) Institute for Apprentices (IfA) endorsement. The standard needs to specify both technical and \u201csoft\u201d skills. The focus should be on work readiness rather than employability Must meet the needs of, and be endorsed by, industry Should be able to recognise both industry-created and academic content. Should allow interoperability between HEIs and industry In particular, must support needs of SMEs Must be flexible Given that there will be several curricula, a core standard with extensions may be appropriate. The core might include such as coding, group work, lifecycle, soft skills. (For theme 2) \u2013 needs to support degree apprenticeships as well as degrees (L6 & L7). (for theme 3) \u2013 would be good if it were possible to specify chunks smaller than a complete degree \u2013 perhaps using some sort of \u201clayering\u201d or \u201ccomponent\u201d model. Should link to other accreditations e.g., BCS, IET Will be different from Tech Partnership Degrees (TPD) standards for degree apprenticeships. Industry involvement in the development and adoption of the standard is crucial. This will require ongoing involvement of individuals from a wide range of employers from across the sector, constituting a broadly-based industrial panel. 1.3. Constraints Development will require industrial participation in discussions and workshops. If the standard is to be used for Degree Apprenticeships (DAs), then it needs to address a distinct space from those standards already in operation, primarily those developed/under development by Tech Partnership and ONS. No standard is of value if it is neither accepted by the sector nor implementable. The eventual operation of the standard is outwith the discussion in this paper. The IoC is not (yet) authorised to accredit anything \u2013 at best, it might offer a \u201ckite mark\u201d endorsement. Only professional bodies, such as BCS are currently able to accredit against a standard. 1.4. Opportunities In developing the new standard, we could choose to work with existing accreditation bodies (BCS, TPD, GCHQ), and/or with other bodies such as the SFIA Foundation who manage a user-defined skills framework for the sector. In order to distinguish the IoC standard from other standards, such as those managed by TPD, we might align it to professional qualifications, such as CITP, or CIISP. 1.5. Discussion The separation of the standard from the curricula (workstreams 1.2, 1.3 and themes 2/3) mean that the standard itself needs to be very flexible and adaptable. This is best achieved by abstraction. There is a marked contrast between standards such as the BCS accreditation criteria and the TPD DA standards: the former has relatively few generic requirements that can be contextualised for a particular degree, whereas the latter is essentially a long conjunctive list of requirements. Indeed, in the latter, there is no application of MoSCow (must/should/could/won't) \u2013 all requirements and sub-requirements are given equal weight. One of the key requirements is that the standard must meet industry needs. Although foundational knowledge and principles are important, the key focus is to be on what [graduates] will be able to do. That is, it will focus on skills and outcomes, rather than on curriculum and inputs. And, crucially, the definition of skills and outputs needs to be recognised and accepted by industry. It may be appropriate for the standard to suggest \u201cstaged\u201d outputs \u2013 particularly in the context of degree apprenticeships \u2013 to ensure that those following a standard are \u201cbillable\u201d early in their studies.","title":"Background"},{"location":"standard/background/#1-background","text":"","title":"1.

Rationale for a new accreditation standard 2.1 Aim The Institute of Coding aims to, \"create a new way to develop the digital skills you'll need at work and beyond.\" The purpose of IoC workstream 1.1 is to codesign with industry a new standard for \"digital\" graduates. As the latest, post-Shadbolt, venture seeking to address the \"digital skills gap\", the focus is on digital skills for the workplace, rather than on knowledge and learning for their own sake. 2.2. Digital skills for the workplace The primary requirements of employers include \u2013 graduates must have proven experience and be ready to work in a professional working environment (competent) graduates must be adaptable (underpinning knowledge for cognate skill areas) graduates must be effective problem solvers (which is fundamentally what university education is about) These are the fundamental drivers for the IoC, not some add-on concept of \"employability\". Competence, adaptability and problem solving are at the heart of the IoC standard \u2013 they are not simply to be retro-fitted to an academic curriculum based on an encyclopaedic Body of Knowledge (BoK). BoKs are reference points, from which curricula are drawn, rather than templates for curricula. Foundational knowledge and principles remain important, but the key focus for the IoC standard is on what graduates will be able to do. That is, it focuses on skills and outcomes, rather than on curriculum and inputs; and hence on competence (as described in a skills framework) rather than on knowledge (derived from a BoK). 2.3. Accreditation standards An accreditation standard is a statement of what all (accredited) graduates should achieve. It describes a minimum level of achievement. The IoC Accreditation Standard set out in this document ensures that graduates will meet the requirements of both the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) outcomes statement and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) subject benchmark statement. Furthermore, graduates from a programme meeting the IoC Accreditation Standard should also meet the educational requirements for BCS Accreditation for at least CITP. The focus on competence rather than knowledge means that graduates may also have gained some of the experience required for chartered status. 2.4. The development of competence Competence lies at one end of a spectrum that starts with knowledge (knowing how to do something), progresses through capability (being able to something in a controlled environment) to competence. This maps more appropriately to Simpson's Hierarchy 1 rather than to Bloom's Taxonomy 2 , the latter being the more usual reference for the design of academic assessment. The two are compared with the competence spectrum, and with each other, in table 1. Level \"Competence\" spectrum Simpson's Hierarchy Bloom's Taxonomy 1 Remember : recall facts and basic concepts Recognition : understand what the problem is Perception : responds to cues in real world 2 Knowledge : knowing how to deal with it Set : ready to apply a known sequence of steps Understand : describe ideas or concepts 3 Capability : have done it at least once Guided Response : imitation and practice Apply : relate information to new situations 4 Conscious competent : doesn't repeat mistakes Mechanism : learned responses with confidence and proficiency Analyse : draw connections amongst ideas 5 Evaluate : justify a stand or decision Proficient : reproducible, reliable, creative Explicit Overt Response: quick, accurate and coordinated performance Table 1 : Mapping between competence hierarchy, Simpson's hierarchy and Bloom's taxonomy The descriptions for the competence spectrum seek to echo some of the concerns expressed by employers for why some computing graduates are not \"competent\", and what it might mean if they were. They draw also on Miller's pyramid (1990) 3 , proposed originally for the assessment of clinical competence, and from the descriptions of nursing competence described by Herman and Kenyon (1987) 4 . These abstractions bear remarkable similarity to the levels of Simpson's hierarchy, rather than to those of Bloom. Note that there is considerable similarity between the characterisations for Simpson's Hierarchy and Bloom's (revised) taxonomy across the first three levels, although the former is fundamentally \"practical\", and the latter \"theoretical\". Indeed, the first level of Bloom seems entirely abstract, which is why it is shown on a separate row of table 1. However, there may be a (weak) argument that perception and recognition are based, at least to some extent, on memory and on association of facts. For the next two levels, despite attempts to assert that \"analyse\" in Bloom's taxonomy might actually mean to analyse the failure of a machine, for example \u2013 something which is eminently practical \u2013 the fourth and fifth level of Bloom are essentially knowledge-focussed, that is, theoretical, and do little to capture practical application; indeed, in many ways, they just enhance \"capability\" without delivering \"competence\". Simpson, for these two levels, is essentially practical \u2013 about doing things, and doing them successfully; this practical emphasis is reflected directly both in Miller and in Herman and Kenyon. Given that employers apparently want graduates to be able to do things, rather than just reason about them, the practical emphasis expressed in Simpson's hierarchy seems more appropriate for the IoC standard \u2013 against which outcomes will be measured - than the purely cognitive perspective of Bloom. This goal may pose challenges for traditional degree programmes, which may currently include few opportunities for students actually to practise their skills in the real world. But a focus on competence \u2013 rather than just capability, however advanced \u2013 is entirely in keeping with the goals for the IoC. 2.5. Reference to skills framework Since competence is described in skills frameworks rather than BoKs, it is appropriate to express the IoC standard, which focusses on competence, in terms of a relevant skills framework. As noted in Bowers and Howson (2019) 5 , for the computing profession, the most appropriate skills framework is the Skills Framework for the Information Age, SFIA 6 , now in version 7. 2.5.1 The SFIA Framework SFIA is industry focussed, maintained and updated regularly by its user community (primarily employers). It has become the de facto global IT skills Framework, used in nearly 200 countries by organisations and individuals to characterise and manage their skills. The underlying SFIA model is a two-dimensional matrix consisting of skills on one axis and seven levels of responsibility on the other. SFIA (v7) describes 102 skills. Cells in the matrix correspond to individual professional skills at various levels of competence. A role or occupation typically comprises three to six skills, usually at the same or similar levels. 2.5.2 Choice of levels SFIA characterises the seven levels of responsibility in terms of Autonomy, Influence, Complexity, Knowledge and Business Skills. As discussed by Bowers and Howson 7 , (good) new graduates should normally be able to work at SFIA Level 3 \u2013 the \"Apply\" level, corresponding to being a competent practitioner. The responsibility characteristics defined for SFIA level 3 meet virtually all of the generic skills stipulated by both FHEQ and the QAA SBS for Computing, and the majority required for CITP. Competence at SFIA Level 3 is therefore the target for the IoC standard for Bachelor\u2019s degrees. In contrast, experience at SFIA Level 5 (\"ensure\") is the normal benchmark required to attain Chartered status, which one would expect normally to be achieved a few years after graduation. Although this level might be achieved on some post-experience Master's programmes, competence at Level 4 (\"enable\") is more appropriate for the IoC Master's standard. 2.6 The IoC standards - principles 2.6.1 Competence requirements The IoC standards are defined in terms of competences in SFIA skills. The description of a SFIA skill gives exemplar activities that would demonstrate competence in that skill at a particular level. The exemplars are generic, so that there is flexibility in how they should be interpreted in a particular environment. Furthermore, even if a given individual is not performing all of the suggested activities, that does not mean they are not competent. SFIA is not a conjunctive checklist; the target for competence in a skill should be to meet most of the description specified for the skill at the required level. 2.6.2 Using BoKs Bodies of Knowledge should be drawn upon to design curricula to develop (focussed) competence. 2.6.3 Number of competence skills The only place that most undergraduate students (without the benefit of a placement / internship etc.) will be able to demonstrate competence is likely to be in their final year (capstone) project. In that context, it is probable that there will be scope for the majority of students to develop competence corresponding to only one SFIA skill at (SFIA) Level 3. Similar arguments apply for taught Masters' students. Although projects at Masters level may be more substantial than those for undergraduates, so also are the responsibility characteristics for SFIA Level 4. Hence, in the absence of a substantial placement, Master\u2019s students should be required to develop competence in only one SFIA skill at Level 4. 2.7 Commentary The principal advantages of adopting a standard based on SFIA include: Use of the SFIA framework provides an abstraction mechanism that can assure comparable standards across different curricula; The SFIA responsibility characteristics provide a core which corresponds to the generic skills in IfA requirements, FHEQ and QAA benchmark statements. Underpinning knowledge for additional SFIA skills addresses the FHEQ/QAA requirements for breadth of knowledge. LSEPI and sustainability as explicit additional requirements ensure coverage of BCS CITP accreditation requirements. Those developing different curricula can select skills appropriate to their focus and context; SFIA is not prescriptive about how competence is developed - it allows providers to choose how to deliver that competence, and for competence to be developed by different providers within a single qualification; SFIA is widely recognised across industry \u2013 both in the UK and internationally. SFIA focusses on what it means to be competent \u2013 that is, on particular expertise that is useful in employment, rather than on the curriculum studied to gain that expertise. Given that the focus is on exemplars to demonstrate competence, so that different individuals (students/apprenticeships) may have strengths in different aspects of a skill, this approach avoids the \"conjunctive shopping list\" approach of some other standards. BCS and IET are core partners in the SFIA Foundation. 2.8 Final comments Although the IoC standards are based on the SFIA framework, they are not simply that framework. The standards specify the number and level of skills required by an IoC graduate, together with the range of additional underpinning knowledge. The standards are designed explicitly to meet the stated aims, and do so as follows: Competence in 1 skill => productive, able to operate in a live environment, billable etc. Underpinning knowledge for additional skills => adaptability, breadth of knowledge SFIA responsibility characteristics => employability Non-specificity of standard => flexibility Simpson, Elizabeth (1972). \"Educational objectives in the psychomotor domain\".

Master's degree Graduates should: have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics ( Autonomy, Influence, Complexity, Knowledge, Business Skills ) for SFIA level 4; have demonstrated competence in at least one relevant SFIA skills at level 4 (the competence skill(s)); have underpinning knowledge for a total of three SFIA skills at levels 4 or 5, including the competence skills, and with at least one at SFIA level 5; understand and apply the legal, social, ethical and professional principles that are relevant to their chosen skills; demonstrate an understanding of the need for sustainable computing in the context of their chosen skills. The minimum level of competence which must be demonstrated is: repeated successful application of the components of the relevant skill, in a real-world context, over a period of time. This corresponds at least to conscious competence , or skill in the terminology of ISO 24773. Note that these standards make no assumptions about the format of delivery of a degree \u2013 so, for example, the standards apply equally to university-based degrees, degree apprenticeships and degrees incorporating an industrial placement. Furthermore, the standards are threshold requirements: good or excellent students from IoC programmes may exceed the relevant standard, and this should be reflected in the classification of their degree. Explanatory Notes The demonstration of competence in a SFIA skill requires that students have completed relevant tasks more than just once or twice in a working environment. They should have had repeated experience of those tasks in varying contexts, so that they can repeat them independently in a working environment. In order to achieve competence in any SFIA skill, graduates must also have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for the corresponding SFIA level. Demonstrating these characteristics will probably require evidence from completing a number of independent projects within the scope of the chosen SFIA skill together with evidence of the generic characteristics of Autonomy , Influence , Complexity , Knowledge and Business Skills , as described by SFIA. Since the underpinning knowledge required for at least one skill at SFIA Level 4/5 may be for the same SFIA skill as a \"competence\" skill, the requirement for underpinning knowledge is for sufficient skills to bring the total number of SFIA skills demonstrated \u2013 either by underpinning knowledge or through competence \u2013 to the number required for the specific standard \u2013 that is, a total of four skills for a Bachelor\u2019s degree and three for a Master\u2019s. Some SFIA skills are not defined for the lower levels (2, 3, 4). If such a skill a would be appropriate for a particular programme, the IoC may approach SFIA to extend the skill definition to include the required level. In the meantime, the IoC Accreditation Panel may accept a draft description of the skill at the required level. The computing profession is subject to a range of legal and ethical requirements which may be specific to particular skill areas \u2013 such as accessibility law \u2013 or may be more generic \u2013 such as the provisions of GDPR. Graduates should be fully aware of the legal and ethical requirements that will affect them, as well as the social and professional responsibilities that arise in their work. It is likely that sufficient detail of legal and ethical requirements will have been taught alongside technical material for graduates to have a sound understanding of how these requirements affect their activities. In addition to these explicit requirements, it is likely that any graduate achieving the standard will have additional underpinning knowledge, and possibly competence, corresponding to several additional SFIA skills at Levels 1, 2 or (for Master\u2019s degrees) 3. Instantiation The separation of the standard from the specific curricula (in parallel workstreams 1.2, 1.3 and themes 2/3) mean that the standard itself must be flexible and adaptable. The standard is phrased in terms of demonstration of competence corresponding to responsibility levels in the SFIA framework, but does not mandate any particular skills. Since the responsibility characteristics in SFIA are common across all skills, and the tasks specified at a particular level for different skills are broadly comparable in difficulty, this abstraction approach allows the specification of a standard that is independent of the particular subject focus \u2013 just as the FHEQ, QAA SBS and BCS accreditation requirements are independent of any particular focus. This generic standard can then be instantiated for a number of distinct subject areas, determined by the SFIA skills selected. Recognition of achievement It is proposed that the achievement of \"competence\" and (underpinning) \"knowledge\" for particular SFIA skills at the required levels will be recognised by the award of IoC/SFIA badges. Smaller, micro-accreditation badges may also be offered for micro-modules within the flexible modular framework (theme 3), which could be combined to achieve a single IoC/SFIA \"knowledge\" badge.","title":"The Standard"},{"location":"standard/standard/#ioc-degree-standards","text":"","title":"IoC Degree Standards"},{"location":"standard/standard/#bachelors-degree-with-honours","text":"Graduates should: have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics ( Autonomy, Influence, Complexity, Knowledge, Business Skills ) for SFIA level 3; have demonstrated competence in one or more relevant SFIA skills at level 3 (the competence skill(s)); have underpinning knowledge for a total of four SFIA skills at levels 3 or 4, including the competence skill(s), and with at least one at SFIA level 4; understand and apply the legal, social, ethical and professional principles that are relevant to their chosen skills; demonstrate an understanding of the need for sustainable computing in the context of their chosen skills.","title":"Bachelor's degree with honours"},{"location":"standard/standard/#masters-degree","text":"Graduates should: have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics ( Autonomy, Influence, Complexity, Knowledge, Business Skills ) for SFIA level 4; have demonstrated competence in at least one relevant SFIA skills at level 4 (the competence skill(s)); have underpinning knowledge for a total of three SFIA skills at levels 4 or 5, including the competence skills, and with at least one at SFIA level 5; understand and apply the legal, social, ethical and professional principles that are relevant to their chosen skills; demonstrate an understanding of the need for sustainable computing in the context of their chosen skills. The minimum level of competence which must be demonstrated is: repeated successful application of the components of the relevant skill, in a real-world context, over a period of time. This corresponds at least to conscious competence , or skill in the terminology of ISO 24773. Note that these standards make no assumptions about the format of delivery of a degree \u2013 so, for example, the standards apply equally to university-based degrees, degree apprenticeships and degrees incorporating an industrial placement. Furthermore, the standards are threshold requirements: good or excellent students from IoC programmes may exceed the relevant standard, and this should be reflected in the classification of their degree.","title":"Master's degree"},{"location":"standard/standard/#explanatory-notes","text":"The demonstration of competence in a SFIA skill requires that students have completed relevant tasks more than just once or twice in a working environment. They should have had repeated experience of those tasks in varying contexts, so that they can repeat them independently in a working environment. In order to achieve competence in any SFIA skill, graduates must also have demonstrated the responsibility characteristics for the corresponding SFIA level. Demonstrating these characteristics will probably require evidence from completing a number of independent projects within the scope of the chosen SFIA skill together with evidence of the generic characteristics of Autonomy , Influence , Complexity , Knowledge and Business Skills , as described by SFIA.
